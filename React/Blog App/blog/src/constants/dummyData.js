        "blogTitle" : "6 ESSENTIAL SKILLS FOR REACT WEB DEVELOPERS",

        "blogText":"React is the ultimate library for front-end developers today. Simply put, you get better at development when you learn React, and many organizations view these skills as essential. React developers should be hungry to level-up or audit the skills essential to Facebook’s prominent JavaScript Library.    See how you stack up with these 6 essential skills for React developers. 1. HTML + CSS  No front-end dev is a stranger to HTML and CSS. The ability to work with and craft user interfaces is necessary to every organization. At a high level, React developers should be able to: Work with and write semantic HTML tagsWork with and write CSS selectorsImplement a CSS reset Understand the box model and how to reset to border-box Understand flexbox Work with and implement responsive web principles including the proper user of media queries   2. JSX In React, you never really touch HTML proper. You work with a syntax extension that is truly one of the most remarkable parts of the React ecosystem: JSX. JSX looks so much like HTML you may think of it as HTML-flavored JavaScript. What’s cool about JSX is that if you know HTML and CSS, you intuitively know how to work with JSX.  JSX is an abstraction on top of the React.createElement() API. One reason it is vital to the library—and why the React team chose to go with it in the first place—is that the API would be too cumbersome to use in terms of scaling. One potentially could use React.createElement() to build out an entire application, however this wouldn’t be any more efficient than just using HTML proper. It may feel at first that we’ve taken a step backward by adding our Markup into our template logic, however a few quick minutes with JSX and you’ll be hooked on the style. 3. JavaScript Fundamentals + ES6  You can’t rock React without a firm understanding of the fundamental concepts that the JavaScript language provides, but these ES6 skills are also essential:  Variables and scoping  Understanding when and where you have access to the data you need is critical. Variables are the mechanism built into JavaScript that allow us to hold onto data in memory and access that data later on within our applications.  ES6 brought with it new keywords that we can use to store variables other than the traditional `var` keyword (like `let` and `const`). You may choose to live by the principle that unless you absolutely need `var`, use `const` until your linter tells you otherwise, then default to `let`. Arrays and objectsReact suggests a pattern that your `view is a function of your state`. Arithmetically put, that’s `v = f(s)`, and something you need to remember as you revisit your skills in the foundations of the library.   State is data that we want to show to users or items in memory that we can access in order to allow our users to interact with our data. We hold all of the data that we present on an object called state and access these bits of data via properties on this state object. This is how React received its name; when state changes, the view updates (`v = f(s);`). So your view ‘reacts’ to the changes that are made in your state object.   You should brush up on how to mutate objects and change values of properties on them. Don’t worry, React takes care of the mechanism through a nifty function called `setState()` to make this work to your advantage."

        "blogText":"Data science and machine learning are powerful technologies innovating the world in ways that sometimes seem straight out of a sci-fi film. Today’s machines are not just capable of tedious tasks, but also using complex mathematics to figure out how to chart a path for a rocket to follow or making weather predictions based on historical data.The Imitation Game  Alan Turing, also known as the father of modern computer science, is well known as the mathematician that “cracked the enigma.” Used by the Germans to encode their messages, the Enigma was a key part of the Nazi strategy to safely hide vital information in plain sight. To break the code, Turing created a primitive computer that would consider all permutations at a faster rate than any human could. That helped the Allied forces assure their victory. In truth, this movie doesn’t just tell the story of Turing’s mind, but also describes the process of creating the first-ever machine of its kind and gives birth to not only the art of coding and creating machines, but also that of cryptography and cybersecurity."

        "blogText":"There are many beautiful places in Nepal that you haven’t visited yet. Hiking simply means walking for hours and hours, enjoying each trail and it is a journey that adds joy in your boring life. Being limited inside your home or at your office room will make your life dull. You may be leading a busy life and couldn’t get holidays for traveling. But then, there are few places that will make your journey memorable. You shouldn’t allocate more time for the sake of hiking. If you are from Kathmandu, do read it once. This time we are focusing on hiking around Kathmandu."

        "blogText":"Pizza dough is a yeasted dough which requires active dry yeast. Make sure the check the expiration date on the yeast package! Yeast that is too old may be dead and won't work. You can use all purpose flour instead of the bread flour that is called for in the recipe, but bread flour is higher in gluten than all-purpose flour and will make a crispier crust for your pizza. Cup measurements can vary depending on how you are scooping the flour (we fluff the flour, lightly scoop it, and level with a knife). So I recommend using a kitchen scale to measure out the flour amounts by weight. This is the only way you'll get a consistently accurate measurement."

Yes these are a few of the favourite things about Dashain. And our celebrities share their thoughts on these aspects of this great festival."
